What did I learn from my first project?

- USE GITHUB TO TRACK YOUR PROGRESS.
- style css with larger min width media queries closer to the top
- how my perfectionism prevents me from moving forward
- lowering my expectations on what can be accomplished
- add comments as you go
- don't be afraid to reach out and ask questions
- how to wrangle css
- how to arrange states and contexts in a React app
- how to use useRef and useEffect
- how to use LottieFiles
- how to use SynfigStudios
- how to use three js
- how to use d3 js
- how to be patient

Challenges that I overcame?

- how to create nested arrays based on where pixels are colored in.
- how to create a better 3D model
- how to tweak Three Js's svgloader example to the app's specific needs
- how to position tiles
- how to use react-three-fiber Instances
- how to design a large function that would convert given settings into a tile layout
- how to design a timer properly
- how to end a game

Things I wish I could include in the project but was unable to?

- a larger number of tiles, but the symbols were in svg form and had many mesh parts, therefore they were making the game lag too much. I tried to change their color and then convert them to a png but that was ineffective because .onload only worked half of the time. Looking back, I think I was being overly optimistic with how many symbol and color combos people can remember. In the end, I simply reduced the number of tiles people could choose.

- having a timeline using d3. Due to wanting to finish this project sooner rather than later, I settled with creating at least one graph to understand the library, and then deleting the component.

- allowing users to import their own svg symbols, however React wasn't very friendly with displaying/previewing xml elements. Luckily I provided some presets that people can choose from. In general svgs were a pain to work with in this project.
